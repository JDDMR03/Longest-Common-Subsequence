# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

## Introduction
Longest common subsequence is longest subsequence common among all sequences. It is different from substring in a way that it doesnâ€™t have to include characters of continuous position. It is used in data comparison, bioinformatics and in computational linguistics. It is also used by version control system.

## Dynamic programming approach
Dynamic programming offers solution of longest common subsequence problem in polynomial time complexity. Dynamic programming breaks down problem in simple sub-problems in recursive manner and then optimally finds solution of sub-problems to find optimal solution of original problem.

## Contents of repository
**LongestCommonSubsequence.pdf** is detailed tutorial document of dynamic programming approach to solve longest common subsequence problem. It explain concept in very detail with pictorial example and include detailed explanation of table creation process and parsing the table to find LCS in step by step manner.
